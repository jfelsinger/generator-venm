# generator-venm [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jfelsinger/generator-venm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfelsinger/generator-venm) [![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-46797352-2/generator-venm/index)](https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon)

A somewhat opinionated [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for applications built upon the VENM stack.


## Getting Started

### What is the VENM stack?

The VENM stack is a full javascript stack built in the spirit of the MEAN stack, but with Vue.js as a replacement for Angular.

- Vue.js
- Express
- Node
- Mongo

### Install

You can install generator-venm with npm, the same as any node package.

```
$ npm install -g generator-venm
```

This is a yeoman generator though, so if you haven't used yeoman yet, or don't have it installed you'll have to also install it too.

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

To use the generator just run the following.

```
$ yo venm
```
